Rstudio version 1.1.383


Data.
The only data file required is SorariaCompact1.csv in the /Data directory.

Libraries.

Modelling libraries required:

ggplot2 (boxplots)
reshape (in order to present all the boxplots on one page)
rpart (for the decision tree)
rpart.plot (for the tree plot)
knitr (to knit the Rmarkdown file)
kableExtra (this was the only way I could find to produced reasonable looking, numbered tables)

Rmarkdown packages required
lineno (for line numbering)
setspace (for line spacing)
float (for fixing images in the text, but this didn't seem to be working anyway)
