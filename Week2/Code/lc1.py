#(1) Write three separate list comprehensions that create three different
# lists containing the latin names, common names and mean body masses for
# each species in birds, respectively. 

# (2) Now do the same using conventional loops (you can shoose to do this 
# before 1 !). 

# ANNOTATE WHAT EVERY BLOCK OR, IF NECESSARY, LINE IS DOING! 

# ALSO, PLEASE INCLUDE A DOCSTRING AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS FILE THAT 
# SAYS WHAT THE SCRIPT DOES AND WHO THE AUTHOR IS
