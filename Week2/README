To make this a module, and all the functions callable, I added the if (__name__ == "__main__"):bit on the bottom, imported sys and then created a main function tht would run the script.

dictionary_py
I found 2 ways of tackling this, in one I created the keys and added the values in a for loop, in the other, super neat version, I used defaultdic. You tell it that the values are a list, then it works through the list of tuples assigning accordingly.


Chapter 5 Extra Credit - Matching fasta files.

I started this program from scratch in order to learn and consolidate this weeks python.

I created a function to read the fasta file, but the commas, spaces and top two lines had to be removed. I then turned the file into a string

I used the same idea as align_seq to make the longest chain into "longest"

To mimic moving the shorter seq along the longer I removed the first element from the longest chain in a for loop.

I then looked at matches between the two chains using a numpy array.

Since the numpy array equality required arrays of the same size I had to chop the end off the longest chain in incrementally smaller amounts.

Missing Oaks.

The relative paths were wrong, only ../ needed not ../../
I changed the code so that "quercus" could be input (length string = 7) or quercus with a space or spelling errors such as quercuss (length of string not 7)

I am guessing there would by a nicer way to do this, but couldnt find it.
The doctest output was confusing because although I got failed messages, the tests also said passed, ok. I reran the code in a different window, and it worked. I could see that each tree test had passed, so I am not sure what the failed messages were.
