There is 1 script in Code, 3 scripts in Sandbox.

The program reads in data with predator and prey masses, type of feeding, eg insectivorous, piscivororous, and predator life stage, eg, adult, larva etc. 
The last two are in two columns of factors with 5 and 6 levels respectively. The task is to produce linear models FOR EACH predator lifestage, BY Feeding interaction.

I.e., subset by Type.of.feeding.interaction. Then subset this by Predator.lifestae. Then plot a linear model for each. Potentially 30, but not every lifestage is present in each feeding interaction

The columns of interest are Predator.mass, Prey.mass, Type.off.feeding.interaction, Predator.lifestage

All I want to do is:

For (feeds in Type.of.feeding.interaction)
	For (stages in Predator.lifestages)
 	   	ouput = summary(lm(log(predmass) ~ log(preymass)))
   		write(output to a file - appending on to previous output in a nice table)

Output would be something like
	Feeding interaction "Piscivorous" Predator Lifestage "larva"
	R2, F, pvalue...etc
	.92 5	0.05	



Problems I had. 
1)If I used dplyr I could create the subsets using groupby, but I needed to be able to specify what subset I had ended up with so that the output summary was appropriately labelled.
2)dplyr was very wobbly. Somedays it would work, the next not - giving an error about Rcpp 2.17 being needed but only 2.13 was installed. I would delete dplyr and Rcpp from the library and reinstall both, or reinstall dplyr, dependencies = TRUE and sometimes this worked and sometimes it didnt. I wondered if I was using another library package sometimes that somehow screwed it up?

3) Just using loops as above I would always create horrible lists that I found it very difficult to access. For example, the lm coefficients would be in model[[i]]$something. All got very unmanageable (for me)

4)I thought of lapply's etc, but because I wanted to do lm of two columns by factor, couldnt see that I was wanting an apply of any sort which is working on cols not factors??

5)tapply seemd like a good idea, but need to pass two columns in?? mapply?

6)When I wanted to create a list in a for loop I thought I would declare the list, e.g Mylist = list[I put some dimensiosn in here] But it only worked if I used Mylist =  vector(mode = "list"). OK, now I know that - but I spent hours on that one problem. Seemsthat if I was using python, I'd just say Mydf = dataframe[]

General questions
In python the script structure of:

function
function

main

That feels intuitive and simple. But I dont seem to be doing that in R. We werent taught like that, and I cant make a"main" function. Should I be following that same structure and how??

I will be doing lots of linear models, general linear models, on multivariate ecological data. Then making some nice graphs. 

As a beginner to both r and python (spent a few months over the summer on DataCamp, did no python at all until I started this course) I feel like python is easier. Am I missing something? 

Thank you so much for any help/suggestions you've got time to give me.
